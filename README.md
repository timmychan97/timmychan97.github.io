## DefendyPengy
Defendy Pengy is a tower defence-inspired Virtualgame with a friendly theme.  I Defendy Pengy skal du beskytte små, søte pingvinunger mot ville dyr som er ute etter å spise dem. Du kan teleportere mellom tårn og velge mellom å bruke pil og bue eller magi som våpen. Det er to verdener med forskjellig vanskelighetsgrad som du kan prøve ut.

As a developer and graphic designer, I was in charge for the communication between the development team and the graphics team. The work includes supporting the graphics team to make the elements usable in the VR Game, creating the 3D objects, textures, materials and animations. On the developer side, I made teleportation physics, weapon attack and health system, AI navigation for the attacking animals and the game mechanics including the UI and level design.

Here are some screenshots of the VR game:
